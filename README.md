"#goLangGreeting" 

This is my first attempt at a Golang program.
A simple application that asks the user to input their name and then returns a greeting message.

While coding this application, I was able to learn fundamentals about the Go programming language, such as:

Imports, packages, modules, the fmt and the log standard library, how to run the application and so much more.

This will be the first of many Go programs that I will developed as I find it such a fun language to code in.

Happy coding everyone!
